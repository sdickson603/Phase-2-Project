                "Wake exemplifies what this uniform is. Not just the name on the back, 
                it's the name on the front. What he's done in the community and the way 
                he's represented it," said Varitek. "The way he's respected the game. He's exemplifies what it means to be a Red Sox and what it means to be a professional."
